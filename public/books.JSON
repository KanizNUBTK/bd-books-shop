    {"key":"6","name":"Rasha","img":"https://www.amarbooks.org/thumbs/1489221462.jpg","price":"450","discription":"Rasha By Muhammed Zafar Iqbal is another popular teenage novel. Rasha was published in February 2010. Rahsa is a teenage girl and she is the main character in this book. She had parents. But at presents, her father goes to Canada and his mother stays in Australia. She with her grandmother in the village. She grew up in town. But now she lives in the village. She loves this village very much. The story is kind of different yet draws inspiration from the author’s previous works also. I liked how the author portrayed the transformation of Rasha from a city-dwelling timid girl to a confident village girl. She leads a revolution and changes the lives of the village people. At first, her family problems were a big part of the story, but gradually it becomes a minor point."}
